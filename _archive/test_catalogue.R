## This file describes the tests that we envision to have for each function

## 1. DDextract_VitalCounts
 ### a.) Check that an invalid location id results into an output of class NULL.
 ### b.) Check that a valid location id results into a dataframe
 ### c.) Check that if a valid location id is used, the resulting dataframe has 93 columns

## 2. Test that dpi == 2 does not contain subnational ids
