# "752 - Sweden - VR - Deaths - 1961 - Register - WHO-IGME Mortality Data base - Unknown - Direct - Fair" is a case where we do not have Both sexes and we do not have indicator 188 data
# "752 - Sweden - VR - Deaths - 2012 - Register - WHO-IGME Mortality Data base - Unknown - Direct - Fair" is a case that does not have both sexes, 188 data, only abridged and also has 1,2,3,4 instead of 1-4 in the data
# "116 - Cambodia - Census - Deaths - 2007-2008 - Census - Tabulations provided by IPUMS International Database - De-facto - Household deaths - Fair" is a perfect example of a case where the inicator 188 total matches with indicator 194 total
# "533 - Aruba - VR - Deaths - 1987 - Register - WHO Mortality Data base - Unknown - Direct - High quality" has the 1,2,3,4 issue. But 194 total == 188 total.
# "533 - Aruba - VR - Deaths - 2020 - Register - Demographic Yearbook - Year of occurrence - Direct - Fair" has both abridged and complete series

# but the complete only has the minimum age, the closing age, total and/or unknown.
# **"702 - Singapore - VR - Deaths - 2010 - Register - Demographic Yearbook - Year of registration - Direct - Fair" indicator 188 shows that we need to check for a total that matches indicator 188 before we check
# for the latest data source year, since the latest total value could be very wrong.
