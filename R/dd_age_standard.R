# Add standard age groups in the dataset

# The function StdAge.fun adds in the dataset a variable with standard age groups.
# This variable is important to check missing age groups.

# The output of the function StdAge.fun is the dataset with standard age groups.

# Note that the standard series of age group has different open age interval,
# which goes from 60+ to 100+. The function covers all possible open age intervals across countries.
# Later, I will select one open age group for each country/area.
# SH modified this from MN's original function to accomodate any open age groups from
# 40+ to 130+ and also to store this standard age info in a data frame that can be
# modified, as needed, for future use.
